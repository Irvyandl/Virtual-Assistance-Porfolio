  <h2>Dashboard Development Project</h2>
  <p>
    As part of my independent work in process optimization, I designed and developed a fully interactive Power BI dashboard to track weekly ingredient prices and sales performance between June and December 2025.
  </p>
  <p>This dashboard was built with real supply data and used to support strategic decision-making during a seasonal pricing shift.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Used Power Query and DAX to clean, transform, and model weekly supply data across multiple categories (e.g., tomato, cheese, lettuce)</li>
    <li>Implemented KPI cards, line graphs, and slicers to enable dynamic filtering by date and ingredient type</li>
    <li>Enabled stakeholders to visually monitor up to 25% price hikes and prepare early stock actions</li>
    <li>Reduced time spent on manual weekly reporting by 30%, improving operational focus</li>
    <li>Designed layout for clarity and usability even for non-technical users</li>
  </ul>
